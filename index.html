		<h2>Welcome to Fuel</h2>

		<p>
			Fuel is a simple, flexible, community driven PHP 5 web framework. It was born out of the frustrations people have with the current available frameworks and developed
			with support from a community of developers. Fuel is extremely portable, works on almost any server and prides itself on clean syntax.
		</p>

		<h3>Getting started</h3>

		<ul>
			<li>Step #1: <a href="installation/download.html">Download</a></li>
			<li>Step #2: <a href="installation/instructions.html">Install</a></li>
			<li>Step #3: <a href="general/controllers/base.html">Create sexy code</a></li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Optional: Quick Installation</h3>

		<p>If you value your time and want to get things up and running in seconds instead of minutes you can use our quick installer. This will be a single line you write into CLI
			which gives you a very basic version of Oil. From there you can create new full applications of Fuel.
		</p>

		<pre class="cli">$ curl get.fuelphp.com/oil | sh
cd Sites/
oil create blog</pre>

		<p>
			This will create a new Fuel "project" or application for you to start working with. If you were to then run some <a href="packages/oil/generate.html">scaffolding</a>
			you'd have a fully functional blog in minutes.
		</p>

		<p class="note">For now this requires Git, but that should be a simple installation and the benefits really outweigh the effort.</p>
