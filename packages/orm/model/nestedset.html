                    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

					<p>
						<i>This introduction is based on <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/4155/Improve-hierarchy-performance-using-nested-sets">this article</a>, (c) James Simpson.</i>
					</p>
                    <p>
						The nested set model is a particular technique for representing nested sets (also known as trees or hierarchies) in
						relational databases. The term was apparently introduced by Joe Celko; others describe the same technique without naming
						it or using different terms. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nested_set_model">Source: Wikipedia</a>)
					</p>
					<p>
						A typical example of a tree structure is an organigram of an organisation. We'll be using this to explain how nested sets work.
                    </p>

                    <div class="image">
						<img src="./../../../assets/img/nestedset.gif" alt="nested set visual" />
                    </div>

					<p>
						The above diagram is indicating that each node is aware of all its descendants, and vice versa. For example, we can see easily
						enough from the diagram that Ben and Angela are "children" of Bill. We can also see that Tim and James are "children" of Ben.
						This ultimately gives us a link between each member of the hierarchy.
					</p>
					<p>
						For us to represent this we need to store two more values per node, that define the relationship between the nodes of the
						tree structure. These are shown on the diagram in blue and red. We call these Left (<span style="color:red;">red</span> values)
						and Right (<span style="color:blue;">blue</span> values) pointers.
						These values are stored on the table, this is all we need to fully represent a nested sets hierarchy.
					</p>

					<p>
						Those who are into Mathematics know that you can use a different diagram to represent tree structures:
					</p>

                    <div class="image">
						<img src="./../../../assets/img/nestedset2.gif" alt="nested set visual" />
                    </div>

                    <p>
						Although this might look confusing at first, and certainly more difficult to read, it is immediately clear why this is called
						nested sets, and why this way of storing hierarchical data in a flat table is efficient: you can directly see the relation
						between parent and children (all children are contained within their parent), and every node is aware of its parent, and all
						its descendants. Using this representation you can clearly see that all pointers line up beautifully. This will come in very
						handy when we need to access the tree.
                    </p>

					<h3>Storing multiple tree structures in a single table</h3>

					<p>
						You can store multiple tree structures into a single database table. To make this possible, you can add a tree-id
						column to the table. The tree-id identifies the tree the node belongs to.
					</p>
					<p>
						A tree-id may either be an integer or a string, and it can be auto-generated for you when you create a new tree, in case integers
						are used. Integers also make it easier to use the tree-id as a foreign key in a one-to-many relation, and their index lookup
						in the database is faster. It's strongly suggested you don't use a string value as a tree-id.
					</p>

					<h3>Table structure</h3>

					<p>
						You can add as many columns to the table as you want, but to be able to work, the Nestedset Model requires certain
						columns to be present:
					</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Left node pointer, default column name is 'left_id'</li>
						<li>Right node pointer, default column name is 'right_id'</li>
						<li>Tree id, a required column only if the table contains multiple trees (no default)</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						The actual names of the columns used for these functions can be configured in the model. Altough not strictly needed,
						several methods require a "title" or "name" field. The name of this column can be configured in the model as well.
						If you use a method that requires it to be present, but you haven't defined it, an exception will be thrown.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is a minumal stucture for a nested sets table:
					</p>

                    <pre class="php"><code>CREATE TABLE `tree` (
  `id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `left_id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL,
  `right_id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL,
  `tree_id` int(11) unsigned NOT NULL,
  `name` varchar(50),
  PRIMARY KEY (`id`),
  KEY `left_id` (`left_id`),        // optional, might speed up certain lookups
  KEY `right_id` (`right_id`),      // optional, might speed up certain lookups
)
</code></pre>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2 id="configuration">Configuration</h2>

                    <p>The Nestedset Model adds an additional property, <kbd>$_tree</kbd>, to the model, with which you can configure the model:</p>
                    <ul>
						<li><kbd>left_field</kbd> defines the name of the table column that is used to store the tree's <strong>left pointer</strong>. The column name defaults to "left_id".</li>
						<li><kbd>right_field</kbd> defines the name of the table column that is used to store the tree's <strong>right pointer</strong>. The column name defaults to "right_id".</li>
						<li><kbd>tree_field</kbd> defines the name of the table column that is used to store the tree's <strong>id</strong>, a value that uniquely identifies a tree in case you
							want to store multiple trees in a single table. If you use a numeric value as tree-id, the model can automatically assign it when you
							create new tree root nodes. If it is not numeric, you have to supply the value before you call <kbd>save()</kbd>.  There is no default value.</li>
						<li><kbd>title_field</kbd> defines the name of the table column that is used to store the tree node's <strong>title</strong> or <strong>name</strong>. It is optional, the
							Model works well without it, but it is required for some of the models methods. Where applicable this is mentioned in the documentation
							of the method. There is no default value.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The next section show you what a basic Nestedset model looks like, and how you configure it.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2 id="model">Defining the model</h2>

                    <p>
						Using the nested sets model is as easy as extending <kbd>\Orm\Model_Nestedset</kbd> instead of <kbd>\Orm\Model</kbd>.
						This marks your model as being a nested sets model, adds a lot of methods to manipulate trees and nodes, and changes
						the default behaviour of the <kbd>delete()</kbd> and <kbd>save()</kbd> methods to make sure the tree stays consistent.
					</p>

                    <pre class="php"><code>&lt;?php
class Model_Tree extends \Orm\Model_Nestedset
{
	/**
	* @var  string  name of the table to be used by this model
	*/
    protected static $_table_name = 'tree';

	/**
	 * @var  array  array of object properties
	 */
    protected static $_properties = array(
		'id',
		'left_id',
		'right_id',
		'tree_id',
		'name',
    );

	/**
	 * @var  array  array with the tree configuration
	 */
    protected static $_tree = array(
		'left_field'     =&gt; 'left_id',		// name of the tree node left index field
		'right_field'    =&gt; 'right_id',		// name of the tree node right index field
		'tree_field'     =&gt; 'tree_id',		// name of the tree node tree index field
		'title_field'    =&gt; 'name',		//  name of the tree node title field
    );

}
?&gt;</code></pre>
                    <p>
						As you can see, a pretty standard ORM model configuration. The only additional class property is <strong>$_tree</strong>, which defines
						the tree configuration. The model is then set up like a normal <a href="../creating_models.html">ORM model</a>, including any relations
						or other properties that you wish to use.

                <section>
                    <h2 id="usage">Using the model</h2>

					<p>
						Based on the example in the introduction and the model defined above, let's start by creating this tree.
					</p>
                    <pre class="php"><code>&lt;?php
// Bill, our MD, is the root of the tree
$bill = Model_Tree::forge(array('name' => 'Bill'));

// if you save a new node, it will automatically become a tree root node
$bill->save();

// give our MD some subordinates
$angela = Model_Tree::forge(array('name' => 'Angela'));
$ben = Model_Tree::forge(array('name' => 'Ben'));

// they are children of Bill in the tree
$angela->child($bill)->save();
$ben->child($bill)->save();

// add the rest of Customer service
$henry = Model_Tree::forge(array('name' => 'Henry'));
$henry->child($angela)->save();
$nicola = Model_Tree::forge(array('name' => 'Nicola'));
$nicola->child($angela)->save();

// and the development team
$kerry = Model_Tree::forge(array('name' => 'Kerry'));
$kerry->child($ben)->save();
// a sibling of Kerry is a child of Ben too...
$james = Model_Tree::forge(array('name' => 'James'));
$james->sibling($kerry)->save();

// assign the teams benjamin to Kerry
$tim = Model_Tree::forge(array('name' => 'Tim'));
$tim->child($kerry)->save();
?&gt;</code></pre>

					<p>
						As you can see, creating a tree and adding tree nodes is pretty straitforward. One of the main differences between the
						Nestedset model and other ORM models, it that is has methods that operate on other model objects. You don't just query
						the model, or save an object, you do it in relation to another object in the tree. That doesn't mean you can't use the
						traditional methods, <kbd>Model::find()</kbd> and <kbd>Model::query()</kbd> still work like for any other ORM model.
					</p>
					<p>
						Let's move on to describing the methods that are available for getting information out of our tree and manupulating the
						tree structure.
					</p>
                </section>

                <section>
					<h2 id="behavioral_changes">Behavioral changes</h2>

					<p>
						In addition to the primary key, which is read-only in every ORM model object once set, a Nestedset model doesn't allow
						you to make	changes to the left- and right pointers of the node, and to the tree-id if defined. Attempting to do so, either
						via assigment, using a call to <kbd>set()</kbd> or by using <kbd>unset()</kbd>, will result in a <strong>InvalidArgumentException</strong>.
					</p>

					<article>
						<h4 id="method_save" class="method">save($cascade = null, $use_transaction = false)</h4>
						<p>
							The <kbd>save</kbd> method works exactly the same as the regular model's implementation.
						</p>
						<p>
							However, when you use this method on new tree node objects, additional functionality is added to make sure the tree structure
							stays consistent. When you call it on an object and you have used one of the collection methods documented below, the
							new object is inserted in the tree relative to the object passed to the collection method.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you haven't used a collection method, <kbd>save</kbd> will assume you want to insert a new root node. If the model is
							a multi-tree model, it will create a new root with the next available tree-id (if the id is numeric. If not, assign a new
							tree-id to the node object yourself).
						</p>
						<p class="note">
							 If a root node can not be created because one already exists, an <strong>OutOfBoundsException</strong> will be thrown. If
							 the tree-id is not numeric, and you haven't supplied one manually, the result is <strong><u>unpredicable</u></strong>!
						</p>
					</article>

					<article>
						<h4 id="method_delete" class="method">delete($cascade = null, $use_transaction = false)</h4>
						<p>
							The <kbd>delete</kbd> method works exactly the same as the regular model's implementation.
						</p>
						<p>
							If the node you delete is not a leaf node (i.e. is has children), all descendants of the node will move one level up in the
							tree, they will become descendants of the nodes parent. If you want to delete an entire (subsection of the) tree, use the
							<a href="#method_delete_tree">delete_tree()</a> method instead.
						</p>
						<p class="note">
							You can not use the <strong>delete()</strong> method on a root node if the root node has more then one child node.
							Doing so would create an inconsistent tree, as you can't have multiple nodes at the highest level. Trying do to so
							will throw a <strong>DomainException</strong>!

					<h2 id="collection_methods">Collection methods</h2>

					<p>
						Collection methods are methods that allow you to perform an operation, either a <strong>get()</strong> or a <strong>save()</strong>,
						on a part of a nestedset tree. Some methods are available for both, some are only relevant for one. For clarity, they are documented
						seperately. Using a collection method on an operation that doesn't support it will cause an <strong>OutOfBoundsException</strong> to
						be thrown.
					</p>

					<h3 id="collection_methods_get">Collection methods for getting nodes</h3>

					<p>
						Like with standard ORM models, you can use the <strong>get()</strong> method to return an array of objects, and the
						<strong>get_one()</strong> method to return a single object. If a collection method is supposed to return a single result,
						like for example <strong>root()</strong>, <strong>get()</strong> will return an array with that single object. If
						a collection method returns multiple objects, like for example <strong>children()</strong>, <strong>get_one()</strong>
						will return the first object from the result set. It is undetermined which one that will be.<br />
						<strong>get()</strong> and <strong>get_one()</strong> return <strong>null</strong> if no result was found.
					</p>

					<h3 id="collection_methods_save">Collection methods for saving nodes</h3>

					<p>
						Like with a standard ORM model, <strong>save()</strong> will either insert the object as a new record in the table,
						or it updates an existing record in case the object was retrieved from the database.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, unlike a standard ORM model in a nestedset tree is is very relevant <u>where</u> exactly in the tree an object
						is saved. If you don't specify a collection method before save, saving an existing object will just do that, identical to
						normal ORM model behaviour. If you did specify a collection method, the object will be relocated in the tree when you save.
						If your saving a new object, not specifing a collection method will create a new root node. If you did specify one, it will
						determine where in the tree the new node will be inserted.

							but with an added <strong>where</strong> clause in case of a multi-tree model, to make sure the query runs in the context of the
							current tree. It requires a tree-id to be available, so if you call this on a new object, use <strong>set_tree_id</strong> to make
							sure a valid id is defined.
