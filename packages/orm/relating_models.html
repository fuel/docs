		<h2>Orm</h2>

		<p>Orm is short for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_relational_mapper" target="_blank">Object
			Relational Mapper</a> which does 2 things: it maps your database table rows to objects and it allows you
			to esteblish relations between those objects.<br />
			It follows closely the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern" target="_blank">
			Active Record Pattern</a>, but was also influenced by other systems.</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Relating Models</h2>

			<h3>Usage</h3>

			<p>The Orm allows for both eager and lazy-loading of relationships. Eager loading means that some (or all)
				relations are fetched in the original query. Lazy loading means that the relations aren't fetched until
				you request them.</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>// eager loading, using joins:
$post = Model_Post::find('all', array('related' => array('comments')));
// or
$post = Model_Post::find()->related('comments')->get();
// $post->comments is available without any further querying after this

// or use lazy loading, it won't use joins but query a relation once requested
// first get a "post", 1 query without join
$post = Model_Post::find('first');
// now request the comments (not yet loaded), which will do another query without join automaticly
$comments = $post->comments;</code></pre>

			<h3>Basic config</h3>

			<pre class="php"><code>$_has_many = array('comments');</code></pre>

			<p>This example, if specified in <kbd>Model_Article</kbd>, enables fetching of an array of
				<kbd>Model_Comment</kbd> objects which have the field <kbd>article_id</kbd> matching the primary key of
				a given Article instance through the property <kbd>comments</kbd>.</p>

			<h3>Fully configured</h3>

			<pre class="php"><code>$_has_many = array('comments' => array(
	'model_to' => 'Model_Fancy_Comment',
	'key_from' => 'article_id',
	'key_to' => 'parent_article_id',
	'cascade_save' => true,
	'cascade_delete' => false,
	// there are some more options for specific relation types
));</code></pre>

			<p>In the basic example, Orm automatically assumes the model name and field mapping. This example
				explicitly specifies the class name of the target model, the fields used to relate them, and whether
				actions performed on the current object should be cascaded to the target. It will return an array of
				<kbd>Model_Fancy_Comment</kbd> object where the comment's <kbd>parent_article_id</kbd> field
				corresponds to the current object's <kbd>article_id</kbd>. When saving an object the operation is
				also performed on its loaded relations, deleting isn't cascaded by default but can be if you switch
				this on.</p>

			<h3>Configuration Options</h3>

			<p>All of the configurations are optional when using the most common naming conventions.</p>

			<table class="config">
				<tbody>
					<tr class="header">
						<th>Option</th>
						<th>Default</th>
						<th>Notes</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>model_to</th>
						<td>Calculated from alias</td>
						<td>If specified, must the the full class name of the target model (ex. <kbd>Model_Comment</kbd>).<br />
							By default, this value is formed by prepending 'Model_' to the singular form of the alias
							(ex. 'comments' becomes 'Model_Comment'), it is also expected to be in the same namespace as
							the current model.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>key_from</th>
						<td>The key used for the relation in the current model (Usually <kbd>id</kbd>)</td>
						<td>Allows mapping the target model to an arbitrary field in the current model's table</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>key_to</th>
						<td>Calculated from the current model name</td>
						<td>By default, a relationship from a <kbd>Model_Article</kbd> to many <kbd>Model_Comment</kbd>s
							would use the field <kbd>article_id</kbd> in the comments table</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>cascade_save</th>
						<td>bool <kbd>true</kbd></td>
						<td rowspan="2">You can override these options at runtime by passing <kbd>true</kbd> as the first
							argument when calling <kbd>save()</kbd> or <kbd>delete()</kbd> on the originating model.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<th>cascade_delete</th>
						<td>bool <kbd>false</kbd></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>

				<h2>Relation types</h2>

				<p>The Orm supports the following relationship types natively:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="#belongs_to">Belongs To</a><br />
						Has the primary key of the relation keps in its table, belongs to 1 related object.</li>
					<li><a href="#has_one">Has One</a><br />
						Has its primary key saved in one other row of another table (which belongs to this), has 1
						related object.</li>
					<li><a href="#has_many">Has Many</a><br />
						Has its primary key saved in many other rows of another table (which belong to this one), has
						many related objects.</li>
					<li><a href="#many_many">Many to Many</a><br />
						Have their primary keys saved in a table in between which keeps pairs of primary keys from both
						tables. Have and belong to many objects.</li>
					<li><a href="#many_through">Many Through</a><br />
						Same as "Many to Many" but have a model relating them to each other instead of just a 2-column
						table.</li>
				</ul>
