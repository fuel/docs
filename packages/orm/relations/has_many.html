		<h2>Orm</h2>

		<p>Orm is short for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_relational_mapper" target="_blank">Object
			Relational Mapper</a> which does 2 things: it maps your database table rows to objects and it allows you
			to esteblish relations between those objects.<br />
			It follows closely the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern" target="_blank">
			Active Record Pattern</a>, but was also influenced by other systems.</p>

		<section>
			<h2 id="has_many">Relations: Has Many</h2>

			<p>Specifies a one-to-many relationship to another model. The target model must include a
				"<a href="belongs_to.html">Belongs To</a>" reference to the current model to allow the inverse
				relationship.</p>

			<h3>Example</h3>

			<p>Let's say we have a model <kbd>Model_Post</kbd> and it <em>has many</em> <kbd>Model_Comment</kbd>s
				(which in turn <em>belong to</em> the post). The ID of the Model_Post is saved with the Model_Comment
				instance in its own table. This means the <kbd>comments</kbd> table will have a column
				<kbd>post_id</kbd> (or something else you configure), while the posts table won't mention the comments.
				If you keep to the defaults all you need to do is add <kbd>'comments'</kbd> to the
				<kbd>$_has_many</kbd> static property of the Model_User:</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>protected static $_has_many = array('comments'));</code></pre>

			<p>Below are examples for establishing and breaking has-many relations:</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>// both main and related object are new:
$post = new Model_Post();
$post->comments[] = new Model_Comment();
$post->save();

// both main and related object already exist
$post = Model_Post::find(1);
$post->comments[6] = Model_Comment::find(6); // assigning it to comments[6] is not required but recommended
$post->save();

// break the relationship established above
$post = Model_Post::find(1);
unset($post->comments[6]);
$post->save();</code></pre>

			<h3>Full config example with defaults as values</h3>

			<pre class="php"><code>// in a Model_Post which has many comments
protected static $_has_many = array(
	'comments' => array(
		'key_from' => 'id',
		'model_to' => 'Model_Comment',
		'key_to' => 'post_id',
		'cascade_save' => true,
		'cascade_delete' => false,
	)
);</code></pre>
