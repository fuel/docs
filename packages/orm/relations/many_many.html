			<h2>Orm</h2>

			<p>Orm is short for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_relational_mapper" target="_blank">Object
				Relational Mapper</a> which does 2 things: it maps your database table rows to objects and it allows you
				to establish relations between those objects.<br />
				It follows closely the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern" target="_blank">
				Active Record Pattern</a>, but was also influenced by other systems.</p>

			<section>
				<h2 id="many_many">Relations: Many to Many</h2>

				<p>Specifies a many-to-many relationship to another model. The target model will have the same type of
					relationship in the other direction. To allow for these relations you need a table in between with just
					the 2 IDs from both sides of the relation as dual-primary key.</p>

				<h4>Keeping values with the relationship</h4>

				<p>If you need to save values with the relationship table you don't want to use ManyMany but create a model
					in between instead which belongs to both sides of what you would otherwise call the ManyMany
					relationship. It is described under "<a href="intro.html#usage_nested_rels">Usage with nested
					relationships</a> how you can fetch all this.</p>

				<h3>Configuration Options</h3>

				<p>ManyMany relations have three additional configuration options compared to the others. All of these
					are still optional when using the most common naming conventions.</p>

				<table class="config">
					<tbody>
						<tr class="header">
							<th>Option</th>
							<th>Default</th>
							<th>Notes</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th>table_through</th>
							<td>Calculated from model_to and model_from alphabetically ordered</td>
							<td>This is the table that connects the 2 models and has both their IDs in it. For 2 models
								like Model_User and Model_Post it will be named posts_users by default (both plural).</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th>key_through_from</th>
							<td>Calculated from the current model name</td>
							<td>The key that matches the current model's primary key. If your current model is Model_Post
								this will be post_id by default</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th>key_through_to</th>
							<td>Calculated from the related model name</td>
							<td>The key that matches the related model's primary key. If your related model is Model_User
								this will be user_id by default</td>
						</tr>
					</tbody>
				</table>

				<h3>Example</h3>

				<p>Let's say we have a model <kbd>Model_Post</kbd> and it <em>has many and belongs to many</em>
					<kbd>Model_User</kbd>s. The ID of the Model_Post is along with the ID of the Model_User in a table
					called <kbd>posts_users</kbd> (default order is alphabetical). That table has just 2 columns:
					<kbd>post_id</kbd> and <kbd>user_id</kbd> which are together the primary key of that table.<br />
					If you keep to the defaults all you need to do is add <kbd>'users'</kbd> to the
					<kbd>$_many_many</kbd> static property of the Model_Post:</p>

				<pre class="php"><code>protected static $_many_many = array('users'));</code></pre>

				<p>And you need to add a table like this one to your SQL:</p>

				<pre class="sql"><code>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `posts_users` (
  `post_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `user_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`post_id`,`user_id`)
);</code></pre>

				<p>Below are examples for establishing and breaking has-many relations:</p>

				<pre class="php"><code>// both main and related object are new:
$post = new Model_Post();
$post->users[] = new Model_User();
$post->save();

// both main and related object already exist
$user = Model_User::find(8);
$user->posts[1] = Model_Post::find(1);
$user->save();

// break the relationship established above
$post = Model_Post::find(1);
unset($post->users[8]);
$post->save();</code></pre>

				<h3>Full config example with defaults as values</h3>

				<pre class="php"><code>// in a Model_Post which has and belongs to many Users
// = multiple posts per user and multiple users (authors) per post
protected static $_many_many = array(
	'users' => array(
		'key_from' => 'id',
		'key_through_from' => 'post_id', // column 1 from the table in between, should match a posts.id
		'table_through' => 'posts_users', // both models plural without prefix in alphabetical order
		'key_through_to' => 'user_id', // column 2 from the table in between, should match a users.id
		'model_to' => 'Model_User',
		'key_to' => 'id',
		'cascade_save' => true,
		'cascade_delete' => false,
	)
);</code></pre>
