		<h2>Orm</h2>

		<p>Orm is short for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_relational_mapper" target="_blank">Object
			Relational Mapper</a> which does 2 things: it maps your database table rows to objects and it allows you
			to esteblish relations between those objects.<br />
			It follows closely the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern" target="_blank">
			Active Record Pattern</a>, but was also influenced by other systems.</p>

		<section>
			<h2 id="many_many">Relations: Many to Many</h2>

			<p>Specifies a many-to-many relationship to another model. The target model will have the same type of
				relationship in the other direction. To allow for these relations you need a table in between with just
				the 2 IDs from both sides of the relation as dual-primary key.</p>

			<h4>Keeping values with the relationship</h4>

			<p>If you need to save values with the relationship table you don't want to use ManyMany but create a model
				in between instead which belongs to both sides of what you would otherwise call the ManyMany
				relationship. It is described under "<a href="intro.html#usage_nested_rels">Usage with nested
				relationships</a> how you can fetch all this.</p>

			<h3>Example</h3>

			<p>Let's say we have a model <kbd>Model_Post</kbd> and it <em>has many and belongs to many</em>
				<kbd>Model_User</kbd>s. The ID of the Model_Post is along with the ID of the Model_User in a table
				called <kbd>posts_users</kbd> (default order is alphabetical). That table has just 2 columns:
				<kbd>post_id</kbd> and <kbd>user_id</kbd> which are together the primary key of that table.<br />
				If you keep to the defaults all you need to do is add <kbd>'users'</kbd> to the
				<kbd>$_many_many</kbd> static property of the Model_Post:</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>protected static $_many_many = array('users'));</code></pre>

			<p>And you need to add a table like this one to your SQL:</p>

			<pre class="sql"><code>CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `posts_users` (
  `post_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  `user_id` int(11) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (`post_id`,`user_id`)
);</code></pre>

			<h3>Full config example with defaults as values</h3>

			<pre class="php"><code>// in a Model_Post which has and belongs to many Users
// = multiple posts per user and multiple users (authors) per post
protected static $_many_many = array(
	'users' => array(
		'key_from' => 'id',
		'key_through_from' => 'post_id', // column 1 from the table in between, should match a posts.id
		'table_through' => 'posts_users', // both models plural without prefix in alphabetical order
		'key_through_to' => 'user_id', // column 2 from the table in between, should match a users.id
		'model_to' => 'Model_User',
		'key_to' => 'id',
		'cascade_save' => true,
		'cascade_delete' => false,
	)
);</code></pre>
