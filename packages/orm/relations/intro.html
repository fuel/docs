			<h2>Orm</h2>

			<p>Orm is short for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_relational_mapper" target="_blank">Object
				Relational Mapper</a> which does 2 things: it maps your database table rows to objects and it allows you
				to establish relations between those objects.<br />
				It follows closely the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern" target="_blank">
				Active Record Pattern</a>, but was also influenced by other systems.</p>

				<h2>Configuration</h2>

				<h3>Basic config</h3>

				<pre class="php"><code>protected static $_has_many = array('comments');</code></pre>

				<p>This example, if specified in <kbd>Model_Article</kbd>, enables fetching of an array of
					<kbd>Model_Comment</kbd> objects which have the field <kbd>article_id</kbd> matching the primary key of
					a given Article instance through the property <kbd>comments</kbd>.</p>

				<h3>Fully configured</h3>

				<pre class="php"><code>protected static $_has_many = array('comments' => array(
	'model_to' => 'Model_Fancy_Comment',
	'key_from' => 'article_id',
	'key_to' => 'parent_article_id',
	'cascade_save' => true,
	'cascade_delete' => false,
	// there are some more options for specific relation types
));</code></pre>

				<p>In the basic example, Orm automatically assumes the model name and field mapping. This example
					explicitly specifies the class name of the target model, the fields used to relate them, and whether
					actions performed on the current object should be cascaded to the target. It will return an array of
					<kbd>Model_Fancy_Comment</kbd> object where the comment's <kbd>parent_article_id</kbd> field
					corresponds to the current object's <kbd>article_id</kbd>. When saving an object the operation is
					also performed on its loaded relations, deleting isn't cascaded by default but can be if you switch
					this on.</p>

				<p class="note">There is a limitation when fetching relations and limiting their output: you can't use
					complex where statements on the main object. That are queries using parenthesis for nesting conditions
					using <kbd>where_open()</kbd>. Normal (non-nested) where queries can be applied without problems.<br />
					Technically it works like this: to limit the output the query on the base model's
					table is actually a subquery with a limit set on it. Any of those nested where conditions are applied
					on the result of the subquery and further joined relations.</p>

				<h3>Configuration Options</h3>

				<p>All of the configurations are optional when using the most common naming conventions.</p>

				<table class="config">
					<tbody>
						<tr class="header">
							<th>Option</th>
							<th>Default</th>
							<th>Notes</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th>model_to</th>
							<td>Calculated from alias</td>
							<td>If specified, must the the full class name of the target model (ex. <kbd>Model_Comment</kbd>).<br />
								By default, this value is formed by prepending 'Model_' to the singular form of the alias
								(ex. 'comments' becomes 'Model_Comment'), it is also expected to be in the same namespace as
								the current model.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th>key_from</th>
							<td>The key used for the relation in the current model (Usually <kbd>id</kbd>)</td>
							<td>Allows mapping the target model to an arbitrary field in the current model's table</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th>key_to</th>
							<td>Calculated from the current model name</td>
							<td>By default, a relationship from a <kbd>Model_Article</kbd> to many <kbd>Model_Comment</kbd>s
								would use the field <kbd>article_id</kbd> in the comments table</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th>cascade_save</th>
							<td>bool <kbd>true</kbd></td>
							<td rowspan="2">Cascading means the operation on the model is repeated on its relation. Thus
								cascading a save will save the relations as well, cascading a delete will delete the
								relations as well. <strong>Be very careful with cascading delete!</strong><br />
								You can override these options at runtime by passing <kbd>true</kbd> as the first
								argument when calling <kbd>save()</kbd> or <kbd>delete()</kbd> on the originating model.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th>cascade_delete</th>
							<td>bool <kbd>false</kbd></td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th>conditions</th>
							<td><kbd>array()</kbd></td>
							<td>Takes 'where' and 'order_by' keys. These are more limited than the normal usage:
								<kbd>where</kbd> must be an array of arrays containing
								<kbd>array(field, compare, value)</kbd>. <kbd>order_by</kbd> contains an array of fields or
								associative <kbd>field => direction</kbd>.<br />
								<strong>Note:</strong> these are always used and cannot be turned off.</td>

				<h2>Usage</h2>

				<p>The Orm allows for both eager and lazy-loading of relationships. Eager loading means that some (or all)
					relations are fetched in the original query. Lazy loading means that the relations aren't fetched until
					you request them.</p>

				<pre class="php"><code>// eager loading, using joins:
$post = Model_Post::find('all', array('related' => array('comments')));
// or
$post = Model_Post::query()->related('comments')->get();
// $post->comments is available without any further querying after this

// or use lazy loading, it won't use joins but query a relation once requested
// first get a "post", 1 query without join
$post = Model_Post::find('first');
// now request the comments (not yet loaded), which will do another query without join automatically
$comments = $post->comments;

// alternatively, you can use get(), which allows additional conditions:
$comments = $post->get('comments', array('where' => array(array('field', '=', $value))));</code></pre>

				<h3 id="usage_rel_conditions">Usage with where/order_by conditions</h3>

				<p>You can also additional conditions when fetching with the Orm. Note though that would also mean the
					data retrieved will only be valid to the conditions with which you fetched them.<br />
					Additional conditions are only possible with eager loading, though with lazy loading any default
					conditions (see config table above) will be used of course.</p>

				<pre class="php"><code>// using array querying
$post = Model_Post::find('first', array(
	'related' => array(
		'articles' => array(
			'order_by' => array('id' => 'desc'),
			'where' => array(
				array('publish_date', '>', time()),
				array('published', '=', 1),
			),
		),
	),
));

// using method chaining
$post = Model_Post::query()->related('articles', array(
	'order_by' => array('id' => 'desc'),
	'where' => array(
		array('publish_date', '>', time()),
		array('published', 1), // when using '=' it can be omitted
	),
)->get_one();

// but the same can also be done by prefixing the relation name to the column:
$post = Model_Post::query()->related('articles')
	->order_by('articles.id', 'desc')
	->where('articles.publish_date', '>', time())
	->where('articles.published', 1)
	->get_one();</code></pre>

				<h3 id="usage_nested_rels">Usage with nested relationships</h3>

				<p>It is also possible to fetch the relations of relations to an unlimited depth (though you might want to
					be careful creating queries that require too many joins). All these can also be combined with where
					and order_by conditions, some are exemplified below.</p>

				<p class="note">Note that the order matters here, if you want to fetch the relations of a relation you must
					load the "parent" relation before its relation. Otherwise an exception will be thrown.</p>

				<pre class="php"><code>// using array querying
$post = Model_Post::find('first', array(
	'related' => array(
		'articles' => array(
			'related' => array(
				'user' => array(
					'related' => array('profile'),
					'where' => array('active', 1),
				),
			),
			'order_by' => array(
				'published' => 'desc',
			),
		),
	),
));

// using only method chaining
$post = Model_Post::query()
	->related('articles')
	->related('articles.user')
	->related('articles.user.profile')
	->where('articles.user.active', '=', 1)
	->order_by('articles.published', 'desc')
	->get_one();

// or combine array &amp; method chaining
$post = Model_Post::query()
	->related('articles', array(
		'related' => array('user' => array(
			'where' => array('active' => 1),
		)),
		'order_by' => array('published', 'desc'),
	))
	->related('articles.user.profile')
	->get_one();</code></pre>
			</article>
			<article id="join_types">
				<h2>Join types</h2>

				<p>By default the Orm will join relations using a 'left' join. To specify a different join you utilize the 'join_type' condition:</p>

				<pre class="php"><code>$post = Model_Post::find('first', array(
    'related' => array(
        'articles' => array(
            'join_type' => 'inner',
            'where' => array(
                array('publish_date', '>', DB::expr(time())),
                array('published', '=', DB::expr(1)),
            ),
            'order_by' => array('id' => 'desc'),
        ),
    ),
));
				</code></pre>

				<p>
					Since 'where' clauses are executed before the JOIN is executed, you can not get a full OUTER JOIN results when
					you include a 'where' clause, it will act like a pre-join filter. The solution is to define the filter on the
					JOIN itself:
				</p>

				<pre class="php"><code>$post = Model_Post::find('all', array(
    'related' => array(
        'articles' => array(
            'join_type' => 'left outer',
            'join_on' => array(
                array('publish_date', '>', DB::expr(time())),
                array('published', '=', DB::expr(1)),
            ),
            'order_by' => array('id' => 'desc'),
        ),
    ),
));
				</code></pre>
				<p>This will make the selection criteria part of the ON clause, instead of the WHERE clause.</p>

				<p class='note'>Note that if you want to pass a literal value to a join, you will have to encapsulate it in a DB::expr() to avoid it being escaped as a column name.</p>

			<article id="relation_types">
				<h2>Relation types</h2>

				<p>The Orm supports the following relationship types natively:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><a href="belongs_to.html">Belongs To</a><br />
						Has the primary key of the relation kept in its table, belongs to 1 related object.</li>
					<li><a href="has_one.html">Has One</a><br />
						Has its primary key saved in one other row of another table (which belongs to this), has 1
						related object.</li>
					<li><a href="has_many.html">Has Many</a><br />
						Has its primary key saved in many other rows of another table (which belong to this one), has
						many related objects.</li>
					<li><a href="many_many.html">Many to Many</a><br />
						Have their primary keys saved in a table in between which keeps pairs of primary keys from both
						tables. Have and belong to many objects.</li>
				</ul>
