			<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

			<p>Below are some of the most common problems and questions. If you don't find your answer here, head over to our <a href="http://fuelphp.com/forums/categories/orm">forums</a> or the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/fuelphp">FuelPHP community on stackoverflow.</a></p>

			<h3>My relations/foreign keys aren't being saved (1)</h3>
			<p>This happens most often when you're using the wrong type of relationship. Especially Has-one and
				Belongs-to tend to get mixed up. Reread the examples in the docs to make sure you're using the
				correct relation types and check if everything is configured correctly.</p>

			<h3>I can't relate objects (2)</h3>
			<p>Make sure your model is extending <code>Orm\Model</code> and not <code>Model_Crud</code>.</p>

			<h3>I get an exception that my related model in a package/module can't be found</h3>
			<p>Make sure the package or module is loaded by Fuel, otherwise the Autoloader won't be able to find
				the class.<br />
				And when configuring the related model <code>"model_to"</code> make sure you configure the full
				classname, this includes the namespace <em>even if you're in that namespace</em>. Classnames in
				strings are always taken from global context, no matter the current namespace context.</p>

			<h3>I get an Orm\FrozenObject exception</h3>
			<p>Objects can't be edited while being saved to the database, that prevents circular saving and resaving
				already saved objects. This shouldn't happen during normal usage and is most often caused by faulty
				configuration of relations.<br />
				Sometimes this can be caused by a bug, especially when you're not using a stable release.</p>

			<h3>I have defined a limit and offset, but the results are not correct</h3>
			<p>The ORM always makes sure that query results are consistent. If you run a query that contains related
				models, a subquery will be generated to make sure the entire related resultset is fetched. Even if this
				means more records then the limit you have set will be fetched. This is because once you start manipulating
				incomplete resultsets, very bad things might happen to your related models.</p>
			<p>If you are absolutely sure you are not going to manipulate the results, for example because you need them
				for pagination only, you can use <kbd>rows_limit()</kbd> and <kbd>rows_offset()</kbd> instead, which will
				forces them on the entire query.</p>
