		<h2>Orm</h2>

		<p>Orm is short for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_relational_mapper" target="_blank">Object
			Relational Mapper</a> which does 2 things: it maps your database table rows to objects and it allows you
			to esteblish relations between those objects.<br />
			It follows closely the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern" target="_blank">
			Active Record Pattern</a>, but was also influenced by other systems.</p>

		<section>
			<h2 id="creation">Creating Models</h2>

			<p>Creating a model takes little time, the convention is to use the <kbd>Model_</kbd> 
				prefix for the class (eg Model_Article using the filename article.php) and thus 
				place them in <kbd>app/classes/model/</kbd> but you are free to use 
				whatever name you choose.</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>class Model_Article extends Orm\Model {}</code></pre>

			<p class="note">The above only works with the MySQL and MySQLi drivers because it needs to fetch the model
				properties from the database. It is however not very efficient and thus discouraged to use it this way
				because you'll always need that one extra query per model just to fetch the columnnames.</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>class Model_Article extends Orm\Model {
	protected static $_properties = array('id', 'title', 'contents', 'publish');
}</code></pre>

			<h2 id="config">Configuration</h2>

			<p>You can add static properties to the Model to configure it. As we've seen there are none required but
				setting <kbd>$_properties</kbd> is encouraged. All these can be both <kbd>public</kbd> and
				<kbd>protected</kbd> but may NOT be <kbd>private</kbd>.<br />
				Note that all configuration properties are prefixed with a single underscore to prevent collisions with
				your column names.</p>

			<h3 id="table_name">protected static $_table_name</h3>

			<p>When this isn't set the <kbd>Model_</kbd> prefix is removed from the classname and the classname is
				pluralized. Thus "Model_Article" expects table "articles". If you don't follow this convention you can
				change it by setting the <kbd>$table_name</kbd> property.</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>class Model_Article extends Orm\Model {
	protected static $_table_name = 'myarticles';
}</code></pre>

			<h3 id="primary_key">protected static $_primary_key</h3>

			<p>By default this is set to <kbd>array('id')</kbd>, if you use another column name or multiple primary
				keys you need to set this property.</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>class Model_Article extends Orm\Model {
	protected static $_primary_key = array('aid');
}</code></pre>

			<p class="note">The primary key must be a real primary key: unique and unchanging. Don't use it for other
				purposes (like a foreign key in a one-one relation) as well, that won't work as the PK can't be
				changed. The Orm won't check this, and while it might seem to work at first glance: you'll get
				into trouble.<br />
				It is not required for the PK to be auto_increment (though preferred) and you can specify the PK
				yourself, but only the first time. Once it's set, it's set.</p>

			<h3 id="propperties">protected static $_properties</h3>

			<p>There's already a simple example above of adding all model properties, they can also be configured by
			using the columnname as the key and setting options like type, label & validation.</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>class Model_Article extends Orm\Model {
	protected static $_properties = array(
		'id' => array('type' => 'int'),
		'name' => array(
			'type' => 'varchar',
			'label' => 'Article Name',
			'validation' => array('required', 'min_length' => array(3), 'max_length' => array(20)),
			'default' => 'New article'
		),
		'url' => array(
			'type' => 'varchar',
			'label' => 'Web Address',
			'validation' => array('required', 'valid_url')
		),
		'created_at' => array('type' => 'int', 'label' => 'Created At'),
		'updated_at' => array('type' => 'int', 'label' => 'Updated At')
	);
)</code></pre>

			<p>Use of the validation rules shown here to do before save validation is shown in LINK HERE</p>

			<h3 id="relations">protected static $_has_one, $_belongs_to, $_has_many, $_many_many, $_many_through</h3>

			<p>Relating models to each other is explained in <a href="relations/intro.html">Relating Models</a></p>

			<h3 id="connection">protected static $_connection</h3>

			<p>By default this property does not exist and Model::connection() returns <kbd>null</kbd>, but you can set
			it to any other database name configured in <kbd>app/config/db.php</kbd>. Note however that relations don't
			work across connections.</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>class Model_Article extends Orm\Model {
	protected static $_connection = 'articles_database';
}</code></pre>

			<h3 id="observers">protected static $_observers</h3>

			<p>Adding observers is explained in <a href="observers/intro.html">Observers</a></p>
