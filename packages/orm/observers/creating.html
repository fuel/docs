		<h2>Orm</h2>

		<p>Orm is short for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_relational_mapper" target="_blank">Object
			Relational Mapper</a> which does 2 things: it maps your database table rows to objects and it allows you
			to esteblish relations between those objects.<br />
			It follows closely the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern" target="_blank">
			Active Record Pattern</a>, but was also influenced by other systems.</p>

			<h2>Observers: Creating your own</h2>

			<p>You can add any class as an observer by adding the full classname (namespace included) to the Observers
				property of your model. There's 2 ways of creating classes that can be used as observers:</p>

			<h3>Extend the Orm\Observer class</h3>

			<p>Create a new class that extends <kbd>Orm\Observer</kbd> and create methods for the events upon which you
				want your Observer to act. In the example below you want it to act upon <kbd>after_insert</kbd>. The
				method will be passed the Model instance it is acting upon.</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>class Observer_Something extends Orm\Observer {

	public function after_insert(Model $model)
	{
		\Log::info('Succesfully created new object of class '.get_class($model));
	}
}</code></pre>

			<p class="note">Extensions of the type Orm\Observer are singletons by default, as such you can't use a
				method <kbd>instance()</kbd> or property <kbd>$_instance</kbd> or it won't work anymore. Because of this
				methods may be both static or non-static.</p>

			<h3>Have an orm_notify() method</h3>

			<p>When you extend the <kbd>Orm\Observer</kbd> class it inherits an <kbd>orm_notify()</kbd> method that
				will check if there's a method that matches the event and call it when possible. But you can use any
				class as an observer as long as it has an <kbd>orm_notify()</kbd> method. That will be called on events
				and be passed the event name and a Model instance.</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>class Some_Other_Class {

	// it may have many methods and properties before or after the orm_notify method

	public static function orm_notify(Model $model, $event)
	{
		\Log::info('I was notified of the event '.$event.' on a Model of class '.get_class($model));
	}
}</code></pre>

			<h3>Event names</h3>

			<ul>
				<li><kbd>after_create</kbd>, called by the __construct() method once the object was created</li>
				<li><kbd>after_load</kbd>, called by the __construct() method once an object was loaded from the database</li>
				<li><kbd>before_save</kbd>, called by the save() method before anything is done</li>
				<li><kbd>after_save</kbd>, called by the save() method after it has completed</li>
				<li><kbd>before_insert</kbd>, called when an object is first saved to the database</li>
				<li><kbd>after_insert</kbd>, called after an object is first saved to the database</li>
				<li><kbd>before_update</kbd>, called when an object is saved to the database (except for the first time)</li>
				<li><kbd>after_update</kbd>, called after an object is saved to the database (except for the first time)</li>
				<li><kbd>before_delete</kbd>, called when you delete an object from the database</li>
				<li><kbd>after_delete</kbd>, called after you delete an object from the database</li>
				<li><kbd>after_clone</kbd>, called after an object was succesfully cloned</li>
			</ul>
