				<h2 id="introduction">Introduction to ORM</h2>
				<p>The use of the ORM package is <strong>optional</strong>. It can be used to replace the functionality of <a href="../../classes/model_crud/introduction.html">FuelPHP's Model_Crud</a> class. If you are not sure if you should use the ORM package, check out <a href="what_is_orm.html">What is ORM?</a> for more details about the benefits of ORM.</p>

				<p>Unlike many other ActiveRecord implementations, FuelPHP's is small, fast, and dead simple to use. It attempts to make creating, updating, and deleting items from your database as easy as possible. It does this by doing all the hard work for you.</p>

				<p>This introduction will give you a basic overview of the different parts of the ORM package. After reading this, you should have a better idea of the pieces of FuelPHP's ORM and how they interact with one another.</p>

				<p>This introduction will also provide you with a basic example of how to use the ORM Package. Throughout the rest of the ORM documentation, code examples may refer back to this example. We will not go into great detail on any given part since these details can be found in the rest of the ORM documentation.</p>

				<h2 id="parts">Anatomy of the ORM Package</h2>

				<p>There are three main parts to FuelPHP’s ORM package. First, you must setup your Models and configure them. Then you need to configure the relationships between these models. And finally, you access the models to display or update database records. In addition to these three main parts, there are also some additional features including <a href="observers/intro.html">Observers</a> and <a href="eav.html">EAV containers.</a></p>

				<h3>Models</h3>
				<p>In FuelPHP’s ORM package, there are several types of models available; each designed to make a different data access situation simple. Understanding what different model classes you have at your disposel is important to truly utilize the power of FuelPHP’s ORM package. In this introduction, we will briefly look at the standard ORM Model class. You can read more about the other model classes under the <a href="model/intro.html">Models Introduction.</a></p>

				<h3>Relationships</h3>
				<p>Model relationships provide a way to associate each model's data with another model's data. There are a few different kinds of relationships including: one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many. Having these relationships setup is where the true power of ORM comes into play. It allows you to write simple code that can retrieve complex datasets in an organized fashion. Meaning, your code will be easier to read and easier to write. After you create your model classes you are ready to setup relationships between the models. You can read more about setting up relationships under the <a href="relations/intro.html">Model Relationship Introduction.</a></p>

				<h3>Accessing Data</h3>
				<p>Finally, after you have setup your models and their relationships you are ready to access the data. To help you understand how all these parts work together we have included a <a href="#/example">basic example</a> below. We use this example throughout the rest of the documentation's example code.</p>

				<h3>Observers</h3>
				<p>While observers are not required to get started with ORM, they provide some powerful features. Observers are an event based system to allow you to add behavior to specific events. You can read more on the under the <a href="observers/intro.html">Observers Introduction</a></p>

				<h3>EAV Containers</h3>
