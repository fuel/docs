			<h2>Orm</h2>

			<p>Orm is short for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_relational_mapper" target="_blank">Object
				Relational Mapper</a> which does 2 things: it maps your database table rows to objects and it allows you
				to establish relations between those objects.<br />
				It follows the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern" target="_blank">
				Active Record Pattern</a> closely, but was also influenced by other systems.</p>

			<section>
				<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

				<p>Unlike many other ActiveRecord implementations, ours is small, fast and dead simple to use. It attempts
					to make creating, updating and deleting items from your database as easy as possible. It does this by
					doing all the hard work for you.</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2 id="install">Installation</h2>

				<p>The Orm package is included in the Fuel download. All you need to do is enable it in your config.</p>
					<pre class="php"><code>'always_load' => array(
	'packages' => array(
		'orm',
	),
),</code></pre>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2 id="caching">Object Caching</h2>

				<p>By default, the ORM implements object caching, to ensure data consistency. Consider the following example:</p>
					<pre class="php"><code>// fetch a customer record from the client table by its id key
$customer = Model_Clients::find($id);

// give the user a minumum discount of 10%
if ($customer->discount &lt; 10)
{
	$customer->discount = 10;
}

// fetch the same customer record
$client = Model_Client($id);

// print the clients discount
echo $client->discount;
</code></pre>
				<p>
					If you would have used standard database queries, you would expect the printout to show the value of "discount"
					as it is stored in the table record for this customer. With the ORM, thanks to object caching, this is not the
					case. Both queries return the same object (by reference), so the change to <strong>$customer</strong> will be reflected in <strong>$client</strong>.
					If you would <strong>var_dump()</strong> both variables, you will see that they are identical, with the same object #id.
				</p>

				<p>You can disable the retrieval from cache for a subsequent query using:</p>
					<pre class="php"><code>// fetch a customer record from the client table by its id key
$customer = Model_Clients::find($id);

// fetch as a new object using array notation
$client1 = Model_Client($id, array('from_cache' => false));

// fetch as a new object using chaining
$client2 = Model_Client::query()-&gt;from_cache(false)-&gt;where('id', '=', $id)-&gt;get_one();
</code></pre>
				<p>
					If you would dump these three variables, you will see that the objects will have unique #id's, and modifying one will
					not change the other. You can also enable this behaviour globally, so ORM results will never be cached. You need this
					for example in tasks, for batch operations. You wouldn't want to store thousands of objects in memory!
				</p>
					<pre class="php"><code>// globally disable the ORM object cache
\Orm\Query::caching(false);
</code></pre>
				<p>If you have disabled the caching globally, you can enable it on a per-query basis:</p>
					<pre class="php"><code>// fetch a customer record from the client table by its id key
$customer = Model_Clients::find($id);

// fetch as a new object using array notation
$client1 = Model_Client($id, array('from_cache' => true));

// fetch as a new object using chaining
$client2 = Model_Client::query()-&gt;from_cache(true)-&gt;where('id', '=', $id)-&gt;get_one();
</code></pre>

				<p>
					And finally, if you really know you are not going to need or use ORM object caching, you can also create an <strong>orm.php</strong>
					configuration file in your application config directory, and add:
				</p>
					<pre class="php"><code>&lt;?php
return array(
    // global query settings
    'caching' => true,
);
</code></pre>
				<p>
					Under specific circumstances, you may need to flush the complete ORM cache, or part of it. For example it you run a batch processor
					or queue worker, to run background tasks. Since it always runs, it will always re-use it's cache, which can lead to cached values
					being reused while the database has been altered in the meantime. To flush, use:
				</p>
					<pre class="php"><code>// flush the complete ORM cache
\Orm\Model::flush_cache(null);

// flush the cache for a specific model
\Some\Model\Name::flush::cache();

// or by class name
\Orm\Model::flush_cache('Some\Model\Name');
</code></pre>

				<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

				<p>Some common problems and frequent questions.</p>

				<h3>My relations/foreign keys aren't being saved (1)</h3>
				<p>This happens most often when you're using the wrong type of relationship. Especially Has-one and
					Belongs-to tend to get mixed up. Reread the examples in the docs to make sure you're using the
					correct relation types and check if everything is configured correctly.</p>

				<h3>I can't relate objects (2)</h3>
				<p>Make sure your model is extending <code>Orm\Model</code> and not <code>Model_Crud</code>.</p>

				<h3>I get an exception that my related model in a package/module can't be found</h3>
				<p>Make sure the package or module is loaded by Fuel, otherwise the Autoloader won't be able to find
					the class.<br />
					And when configuring the related model <code>"model_to"</code> make sure you configure the full
					classname, this includes the namespace <em>even if you're in that namespace</em>. Classnames in
					strings are always taken from global context, no matter the current namespace context.</p>

				<h3>I get an Orm\FrozenObject exception</h3>
				<p>Objects can't be edited while being saved to the database, that prevents circular saving and resaving
					already saved objects. This shouldn't happen during normal usage and is most often caused by faulty
					configuration of relations.<br />
					Sometimes this can be caused by a bug, especially when you're not using a stable release.</p>

				<h3>I have defined a limit and offset, but the results are not correct</h3>
				<p>The ORM always makes sure that query results are consistent. If you run a query that contains related
					models, a subquery will be generated to make sure the entire related resultset is fetched. Even if this
					means more records then the limit you have set will be fetched. This is because once you start manipulating
					incomplete resultsets, very bad things might happen to your related models.</p>
				<p>If you are absolutely sure you are not going to manipulate the results, for example because you need them
					for pagination only, you can use <kbd>rows_limit()</kbd> and <kbd>rows_offset()</kbd> instead, which will
					force them on the entire query.</p>

				<h3>My query result doesn't reflect the record values in the database</h3>
				<p>Familiarize yourself with ORM object caching, see the explanation given above.</p>
