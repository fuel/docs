		<h2>Orm</h2>

		<p>Orm is short for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_relational_mapper" target="_blank">Object
			Relational Mapper</a> which does 2 things: it maps your database table rows to objects and it allows you
			to esteblish relations between those objects.<br />
			It follows closely the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern" target="_blank">
			Active Record Pattern</a>, but was also influenced by other systems.</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Observers</h2>

			<p>An event based system to allow you to add behavior to specific events. When an event is observed the
				Orm will automaticly call all the added observers to see if there's anything for them to do.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><a href="#add_observers">Adding observers to your model</a></li>
				<li><a href="#included_observers">Included observers</a></li>
				<li><a href="#creating_observers">Creating your own Observers</a></li>
			</ul>
		</section>

		<section id="add_observers">
			<h2>Adding observers to your model</h2>

			<p>You can add observers in 2 ways: just add the name to have the observer called for all events or with
				the observer as name and an array of specific events for which the observer is called.<br />
				When the Observer is in the same namespace as the Model and prefixed with <kbd>Observer_</kbd> you can
				leave out the "Observer_" prefix. In all other cases you have to provide the full classname.</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>class Model_Article {
	protected static $_observers = array(
		'example', // will call Observer_Example class for all events
		'Orm\\Observer_CreatedOn' => array('before_insert'), // will only call Orm\Observer_CreatedOn at before_insert event
	);
}</code></pre>
		</section>

		<section id="included_observers">
			<h2>Included observers</h2>

			<h3>Observer_CreatedAt</h3>

			<p>This observer acts only upon <kbd>before_insert</kbd> and expects your model to have a
				<kbd>created_at</kbd> property which will be set to the Unix timestamp when saving for the first time.</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>// Just add the Observer
protected static $_observers = array('Orm\\Observer_CreatedAt');

// But adding it just for before_insert is enough
protected static $_observers = array('Orm\\Observer_CreatedAt' => array('before_insert'));</code></pre>

			<p>You can change the default property expected and use a mySQL timestamp instead of the defaults:</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>// Use mySQL timestamp instead of Unix timestamp
Orm\Observer_CreatedAt::$mysql_timestamp = true;

// Use property called just "updated" instead of "updated_at"
Orm\Observer_CreatedAt::$property = 'updated';</code></pre>

			<h3>Observer_UpdatedAt</h3>

			<p>This observer acts only upon <kbd>before_save</kbd> and expects your model to have a
				<kbd>updated_at</kbd> property which will be set to the Unix timestamp when saving (also during the
				first time).</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>// Just add the Observer
protected static $_observers = array('Orm\\Observer_UpdatedAt');

// But adding it just for before_insert is enough
protected static $_observers = array('Orm\\Observer_UpdatedAt' => array('before_save'));</code></pre>

			<p>You can change a <kbd>$mysql_timestamp</kbd> and <kbd>$property</kbd> value on this observer just like
				on the CreatedAt observer.</p>

			<h3>Observer_Validation</h3>

			<p>To be written.</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>// Just add the Observer
protected static $_observers = array('Orm\\Observer_Validation');

// But adding it just for before_insert is enough
protected static $_observers = array('Orm\\Observer_Validation' => array('before_save'));</code></pre>

			<h3>Observer_Typing</h3>

			<p>To be written.</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>// Just add the Observer
protected static $_observers = array('Orm\\Observer_Typing');

// But adding it just for these specific events is enough
protected static $_observers = array('Orm\\Observer_Typing' => array('before_save', 'after_save', 'after_load'));</code></pre>
		</section>

		<section id="creating_observers">
			<h2>Creating your own Observers</h2>

			<p>You can add any class as an observer by adding the full classname (namespace included) to the Observers
				property of your model. There's 2 ways of creating classes that can be used as observers:</p>

			<h3>Extend the Orm\Observer class</h3>

			<p>Create a new class that extends <kbd>Orm\Observer</kbd> and create methods for the events upon which you
				want your Observer to act. In the example below you want it to act upon <kbd>after_insert</kbd>. The
				method will be passed the Model instance it is acting upon.</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>class Observer_Something extends Orm\Observer {

	public function after_insert(Model $model)
	{
		\Log::info('Succesfully created new object of class '.get_class($model));
	}
}</code></pre>

			<p class="note">Extensions of the type Orm\Observer are singletons by default, as such you can't use a
				method <kbd>instance()</kbd> or property <kbd>$_instance</kbd> or it won't work anymore. Because of this
				methods may be both static or non-static.</p>

			<h3>Have an orm_notify() method</h3>

			<p>When you extend the <kbd>Orm\Observer</kbd> class it inherits an <kbd>orm_notify()</kbd> method that
				will check if there's a method that matches the event and call it when possible. But you can use any
				class as an observer as long as it has an <kbd>orm_notify()</kbd> method. That will be called on events
				and be passed the event name and a Model instance.</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>class Some_Other_Class {

	// it may have many methods and properties before or after the orm_notify method

	public static function orm_notify(Model $model, $event)
	{
		\Log::info('I was notified of the event '.$event.' on a Model of class '.get_class($model));
	}
}</code></pre>

			<h3>Event names</h3>

			<ul>
				<li><kbd>after_create</kbd>, called by the __construct() method once the object was created</li>
				<li><kbd>after_load</kbd>, called by the __construct() method once an object was loaded from the database</li>
				<li><kbd>before_save</kbd>, called by the save() method before anything is done</li>
				<li><kbd>after_save</kbd>, called by the save() method after it has completed</li>
				<li><kbd>before_insert</kbd>, called when an object is first saved to the database</li>
				<li><kbd>after_insert</kbd>, called after an object is first saved to the database</li>
				<li><kbd>before_update</kbd>, called when an object is saved to the database (except for the first time)</li>
				<li><kbd>after_update</kbd>, called after an object is saved to the database (except for the first time)</li>
				<li><kbd>before_delete</kbd>, called when you delete an object from the database</li>
				<li><kbd>after_delete</kbd>, called after you delete an object from the database</li>
				<li><kbd>after_clone</kbd>, called after an object was succesfully cloned</li>
			</ul>
