		<h2>Orm</h2>

		<p>Orm is short for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_relational_mapper" target="_blank">Object
			Relational Mapper</a> which does 2 things: it maps your database table rows to objects and it allows you
			to esteblish relations between those objects.<br />
			It follows closely the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern" target="_blank">
			Active Record Pattern</a>, but was also influenced by other systems.</p>

		<section>
			<h2>Observers</h2>

			<p>An event based system to allow you to add behavior to specific events. When an event is observed the
				Orm will automaticly call all the added observers to see if there's anything for them to do.</p>

			<ul>

			</ul>

			<h2>Adding observers to your model</h2>

			<p>You can add observers in 2 ways: just add the name to have the observer called for all events or with
				the observer as name and an array of specific events for which the observer is called.<br />
				When the Observer is in the same namespace as the Model and prefixed with <kbd>Observer_</kbd> you can
				leave out the "Observer_" prefix. In all other cases you have to provide the full classname.</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>class Model_Article {
	protected static $_observers = array(
		'typing', // will call Orm\Observer_Typing for all events
		'createdon' => array('before_insert'), // will only call Orm\Observer_CreatedOn at before_insert event
	);
}</code></pre>
		</section>

		<section id="included_observers">
			<h2>Included observers</h2>

			<h3>Observer_CreatedOn</h3>

			<p>This observer acts only upon <kbd>before_insert</kbd> and expects your model to have a
				<kbd>created_on</kbd> property which will be set to the Unix timestamp when saving for the first time.</p>

			<h3>Observer_UpdatedOn</h3>

			<p>This observer acts only upon <kbd>before_save</kbd> and expects your model to have a
				<kbd>updated_on</kbd> property which will be set to the Unix timestamp when saving (also during the
				first time).</p>

			<h3>Observer_Validation</h3>

			<p>To be written.</p>

			<h3>Observer_Typing</h3>

			<p>To be written.</p>
		</section>

		<section id="creating_observers">
			<h2>Creating your own Observers</h2>

			<p>You can add any class as an observer by adding the full classname (namespace included) to the Observers
				property of your model. There's 2 ways of creating classes that can be used as observers:</p>

			<h3>Extend the Orm\Observer class</h3>

			<p>Create a new class that extends <kbd>Orm\Observer</kbd> and create methods for the events upon which you
				want your Observer to act. In the example below you want it to act upon <kbd>after_insert</kbd>. The
				method will be passed the Model instance it is acting upon.</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>class Observer_Something extends Orm\Observer {

	public function after_insert(Model $model)
	{
		\Log::info('Succesfully created new object of class '.get_class($model));
	}
}</code></pre>

			<p class="note">Extensions of the type Orm\Observer are singletons by default, as such you can't use a
				method <kbd>instance()</kbd> or property <kbd>$_instance</kbd> or it won't work anymore. Because of this
				methods may be both static or non-static.</p>

			<h3>Have an orm_notify() method</h3>

			<p>When you extend the <kbd>Orm\Observer</kbd> class it inherits an <kbd>orm_notify()</kbd> method that
				will check if there's a method that matches the event and call it when possible. But you can use any
				class as an observer as long as it has an <kbd>orm_notify()</kbd> method. That will be called on events
				and be passed the event name and a Model instance.</p>

			<pre class="php"><code>class Some_Other_Class {

	// it may have many methods and properties before or after the orm_notify method

	public static function orm_notify(Model $model, $event)
	{
		\Log::info('I was notified of the event '.$event.' on a Model of class '.get_class($model));
	}
}</code></pre>
