		<h2>HMVC requests</h2>

		<p>
			HMVC requests are a great way to separate logic and re-use controller logic in multiple places.
			One common use of this is when you use a theme or template engine to generate your pages,
			where every page is divided into sections, and sections are populated by widgets.
			By using modules to produce the widget output, you can create a highly modular application with easy to re-use components.
		</p>

		<p>You call a module controller method using the <a href="../classes/request.html">Request</a> class:</p>
		<pre class="php"><code>// fetch the output of a controller
$widget = Request::factory('mycontroller/mymethod/parms')->execute();
echo $widget;

// or fetch the output of a module
$widget = Request::factory('mymodule/mycontroller/mymethod/parms', false)->execute();
echo $widget;
</code></pre>
		<p class="note">
			By default, all requests made are processed by Fuel's routing engine. If you want to request something that is not routable
			(for example because you do not want a browser to request it) you should pass '<strong>false</strong>' as second parameter
			to the factory() call. If you do not you will end up with a 404 error when you execute the request!
		</p>

		<p>
			Loading views in an HMVC request is the same as in normal requests, and controllers accessed by an HMVC request are also approachable via the browser. In some cases (for example, widgets) browser access should not be allowed. In those cases you will want to check if the request is made through HMVC or the browser. The following example shows you how to check for an HMVC request:
		</p>

		<pre class="php"><code>&lt;?php

class Controller_Widget extends Controller {

	public function action_show()
	{
		if(Request::main() === Request::active())
		{
			// this is the main request
		}
		else
		{
			// this is an HMVC request
		}
	}

}</code></pre>

		<h3>404 during HMVC requests</h3>

		<p>
			When a 404 occurs during an HMVC request a Request404Exception is thrown. If uncaught it will trigger
			a full 404 message using <kbd>Request::show_404()</kbd>, but you can prevent this and handle the 404
			yourself:
		</p>

		<pre class="php"><code>try
{
	\Request::factory('this_will_fail');
}
catch (Request404Exception $e)
{
	// deal with it
}
</code></pre>

		<h3>Traversing request instances</h3>

		<p>If you want to access other requests you can traverse them using two methods:
			<kbd>$request->parent()</kbd> and <kbd>$request->children</kbd>. The parent is the request during
			which the current request was created (null for the main request). The children are all the requests
			created during the current request.</p>
