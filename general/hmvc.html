		<h2>HMVC requests</h2>

		<p>
			HMVC requests are a great way to separate logic and re-use controller logic in multiple places.
			One common use of this is when you use a theme or template engine to generate your pages,
			where every page is divided into sections, and sections are populated by widgets.
			By using modules to produce the widget output, you can create a highly modular application, with easy to re-use components.
		</p>

		<p>You call a module controller method using the <a href="../classes/request.html">Request</a> class:</p>
		<pre class="php"><code>// fetch the output of a controller
$widget = Request::factory('mycontroller/mymethod/parms', false)->execute();
echo $widget;

// or fetch the output of a module
$widget = Request::factory('mymodule/mycontroller/mymethod/parms', false)->execute();
echo $widget;
</code></pre>
		<p class="note">
			Note that you have to use '<strong>false</strong>' as second parameter to the factory() call, to prevent your URI to be routed.
			If you don't, and you request a non-routable URI, you will end up with a 404 error!
		</p>

		<p>Loading views in HMVC request is the same as in normal requests and controller accessed by HMVC request are also approuchable via the browser. In same cases, for example widgets, are not suppose to accessed through the browser. In those cases you'll want to check if the request is made through HMVC or the browser. The following expample shows you how to check for a HMVC request:</p>
		
		<pre class="php"><code>&lt;?php

class Controller_Widget extends Controller {

	public function action_show()
	{
		if(Request::main() === Request::active())
		{
			// this is the main request
		}
		else
		{
			// this is a HMVC request
		}
	}

}

</code></pre>
