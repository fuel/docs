			<h2>Controllers</h2>
	
			<h3 id="what_is_a_controller">What is a controller?</h3>
	
			<p>
				Controllers are classes that can be reached through the URL and take care of handling the request.
				A controller calls models and other classes to fetch the information. Finally, it will pass everything
				to a view for output. If a URL like www.yoursite.com/example/index is requested, the first segment
				("example") will be the controller that is called and the second segment ("index") will be the method
				of that controller that is called.
			</p>
	
			<h3 id="creating_a_controller">Creating a controller</h3>
	
			<p>
				In FuelPHP, Controllers are put in the <kbd>fuel/app/classes/controller</kbd> directory. They should,
				optionally, extend the <kbd>Controller</kbd> class and be prefixed with <kbd>"Controller_"</kbd>.
				Below is an example of the controller "example":
			</p>
	
			<pre class="php"><code>class Controller_Example extends Controller
{

	public function action_index()
	{
		$data['css'] = Asset::css(array('reset.css','960.css','main.css'));
		return Response::forge(View::forge('welcome/index'));
	}
}</code></pre>
	
			<p>
				Methods that can be requested through the URL are prefixed with <kbd>"action_"</kbd>. This means
				that you're not limited by PHP's constructs on which name you might use (example: method "list"
				isn't allowed, "action_list" is no problem). But this also means you can give your controller public
				methods that can be used from other classes but are not routable.
			</p>
	
			<h4 id="more_parameters">Using more parameters from the URL</h4>
	
			<p>Let say we also have the following method in our Controller_Example: </p>
	
	<pre class="php"><code>public function action_name_to_upper($name_1, $name_2)
{
	$data['name_1'] = strtoupper($name_1);
	$data['name_2'] = strtoupper($name_2);
	return View::forge('test/name_to_upper', $data);
}</code></pre>
	
			<p>
				If we call this method using: <kbd>www.yoursite.com/example/name_to_upper/fuel/php</kbd>, it will
				return the view <kbd>test/name_to_upper</kbd>. "Fuel" and "PHP" will be passed along as values
				<var>$name_1</var> and <var>$name_2</var> in the <var>$data</var> array.
			</p>
	
			<h4 id="controller_in_subdir">Controller in a Sub-Directories</h4>
	
			<p>
				You can also put a controller in a subdirectory, like
				<kbd>fuel/app/classes/controller/subdir/test.php</kbd>. In this case, the controller must include
				the dirname in the classname like this: <var>Controller_Subdir_Test</var>.
			</p>
	
			<p>
				Unlimited nested sub-directories are supported, so
				<kbd>fuel/app/classes/controller/subdir1/subdir2/subdir3/test.php</kbd>. would have a class name of
				<var>Controller_Subdir1_Subdir2_Subdir3_Test</var>.
			</p>
	
			<h3 id="special_methods">Special controller methods</h3>
	
			<p class="note">
				Don't overwrite the class constructor <kbd>__construct()</kbd>, use <kbd>before()</kbd> instead.
				Unless you have studied the base Controller from the Core first and understand how it must be extended
				not to break Fuel.
			</p>
	
			<article>
				<h4 id="action_index">action_index()</h4>
				<p>
					This method will be called if the controller is called without a second parameter. In the above
					example <kbd>www.yoursite.com/example/index</kbd> will be the same as
					<kbd>www.yoursite.com/example</kbd>.
				</p>
			</article>
	
			<article>
				<h4 id="before">before()</h4>
				<p>
					This method will be executed <strong>before</strong> the method from the URL is called on your
					controller, even if that method turns out not to exist.
				</p>
			</article>
	
			<article>
				<h4 id="after">after($response)</h4>
				<p>
					This method will be executed <strong>after</strong> the method from the URL was called successfully,
					this will not be called if the method turns out not to exist. <a href="#response"><var>$response</var></a> parameter is required.</a>
				</p>
			</article>
	
			<article>
				<h4 id="router">router($method, $params)</h4>
				<p>
					This method will take over the internal routing of the controller. Once the controller is loaded,
					the router() method will be called and use the <var>$method</var> that is being passed in, instead
					of the default method. It will also pass in <var>$params</var>, in an array, to that
					<var>$method</var>. The before() and after() methods will still work as expected.
				</p>
			</article>
	
			<h3 id="special_propperties">Special controller properties</h3>
	
			<article>
				<h4 id="request">$request</h4>
				<p>
					This property holds the Request object. It should not be overwritten. It should be used to get
					information about the current request. It should be thought of as read-only.
				</p>
			</article>
	
			<article>
				<h4 id="response">$response</h4>
				<p>
					This property holds the Reponse object. To output something, add it to the
					<kbd>$this->response->body</kbd> property.
				</p>
			</article>
	
			<h3 id="extending_other_controllers">Extending other controllers</h3>
	
			<p>
				Thanks to the autoloader, you can extend other controllers without writing anything more than its
				name in the class definition:
			</p>
			
			<pre class="php"><code>class Controller_Example extends Controller_Welcome
{

	// your methods

}</code></pre>
	
			<p>
				This may sound strange at first, but extending controllers allows you to share methods and create base
				controllers really easily.
			</p>
	
			<h3>Creating Base Controllers</h3>
	
			<p>
				A base controller is a shared controller, like <kbd>Controller_Public</kbd> or <kbd>Controller_Admin</kbd> and are used to share logic between groups of controllers.
				For example, the <kbd>Controller_Admin</kbd> controller could contain your login/logout actions and maybe a dashboard, but it could also contain a <kbd>before()</kbd> method
				that checks to see if the user is logged in as an admin. Then all other controllers in your admin panel will extend this and automatically be secured.
			</p>
	
			<pre class="php"><code>class Controller_Admin extends Controller
{

	public function before()
	{
		// check for admin
	}

	// your methods

	public function action_index()
	{
		// load the dashboard
	}

	public function action_login()
	{
		// log in the user
	}
}</code></pre>
	
			<p>
				That code will go in <kbd>fuel/app/classes/controller/admin.php</kbd> and all of your other controllers
				should go in <kbd>fuel/app/classes/controller/admin/</kbd>, like this one:
			</p>
	
			<pre class="php"><code>class Controller_Admin_User extends Controller_Admin
{

	public function action_index()
	{
		// overrides the dashboard with the user index listing
	}

	public function action_edit($id)
	{
		// edit users
	}
}</code></pre>
