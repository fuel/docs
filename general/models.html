		<h2>Models</h2>

		<h3>What are models?</h3>

		<p>
			Whenever data needs to be retrieved, manipulated or deleted this should always be done by a model. A Model is a representation of some kind of
			data and has the methods to change them. For example: you never put SQL queries in a Controller, those are put in the Model and the Controller will
			call upon the Model to execute the queries. This way if your database changes you won't need to change all your Controllers but just the Model that acts upon it.
		</p>

		<h3>How are Models used?</h3>

		<p>
			In Fuel a Model is essentially just a <a href="classes.html" title="Class Documentation">Class</a> like any other. They do nothing more than a library, but the Model_ prefix
			helps to differentiate it from other classes. To do something useful with a Model you will need to use other classes.
		</p>

		<h3>Writing SQL Queries</h3>

		<p>You can use the <a href="../classes/db.html">DB class</a> to build queries with native SQL like so:</p>

		<pre class="php"><code>DB::query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 5');</code></pre>

		<h3>Using the Query Builder</h3>

		<p>When it comes to escaping data, working with data in arrays or making an application portable over multiple database engines, you might find native
			SQL to be rather cumbersome. Using the Query Builder methods in the DB Class you can abstract writing native SQL:
		</p>
		
		<pre class="php"><code>DB::select('title, content')->from('articles')->execute()->get();</code></pre>

		<p>See more about native SQL queries and using the Query Builder in the <a href="../classes/db.html">DB class</a> documentation.</p>

		<h3>Don't like SQL at all?</h3>

		<p>If you find working with both native SQL and Query Builder methods to be cumbersome or illogical then why not try out the <a href="../packages/orm/intro.html">Orm Package</a>.</p>

		<pre class="php"><code>// find all articles
$entry = Model_Article::find('all');

// find all articles from category 1 order descending by date
$entry = Model_Article::find('last', array(
    'where' => array('category_id', 1),
    'order_by' => array('date', 'desc')
));</code></pre>
