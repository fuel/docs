		<h2>Model-View-Controller (MVC)</h2>

		<h3 id="what_is_mvc">What is MVC?</h3>

		<p>MVC is an approach to separating your code depending on what role it plays in your application. In the
		application flow it starts with a controller that is loaded. That controller executes a method which retrieves
		data using models. Once it is done the controller decides what view to load, which contains the output your
		visitors get to see.</p>

		<h2 id="controllers">Controllers</h2>

		<p>Fuel's routing decides, based on the requested URL, what controller to load and what method to call upon it.
		This is where your application starts working. The controller decides what actions to take, what to do with any
		user input, what data gets manipulated and which view is shown to the user. The controller does none of these
		things itself. Instead, it calls upon models and classes to do the work.</p>

		<h2 id="models">Models</h2>

		<p>Whenever data needs to be retrieved, manipulated or deleted this should always be done by a model. A model
		is a representation of some kind of data and has the methods to change them. For example: you never put SQL
		queries in a controller. Those are put in the model and the controller will call upon the model to execute
		the queries. This way if your database changes you will not need to change all of your controllers, but just the
		model that acts upon it.</p>

		<h2 id="views">Views</h2>

		<p>Views contain your HTML, which should never be found in your controllers or any other class that is not
		specifically meant to create output. By separating your layout from your logic you ensure that when you decide
		to change your layout you only have to change the views and you will not have to care about the controllers.<br />
		Views should thus contain little more than <kbd>echo</kbd> and <kbd>foreach</kbd> usage of PHP.</p>

		<h3 id="viewmodels">ViewModels</h3>

		<p>Once your application gets more complex you will discover that it gets hard to decide if a piece of logic
		really belongs in the controller. What if it is very specifically about the view and has little to do with your
		application logic? This is where ViewModels come in; they are the glue between your controllers and your
		views.</p>
